    <filename>referee</filename> is a <productname>&productname;</productname>
    extension for managing quorum settings in clusters with an even number
    of nodes configured with <link linkend="multimaster">multimaster</link>.
    Installed on a separate system, the <filename>referee</filename>
    extension provides a voting node to assign the quorum status to a subset
    of nodes if only half of the cluster nodes remain connected to each other.
  </para>
  <para>
    If a multi-master cluster is split into equal parts, or half of the
    cluster nodes fail, each subset of nodes that equals half of the
    cluster tries to access the referee.
    The first subset that gets connected to the referee wins the voting
    and continues working, while all the other nodes are excluded from
    the cluster to avoid split-brain problems.
  </para>

  <para>
    The referee node does not store any cluster data, so it is very lightweight
    and can be located on systems with limited resources. For details on how
    to set up and use a referee node with <filename>multimaster</filename>,
    see <xref linkend="setting-up-a-referee">.
