Roadmap:
1. Make learn query utility.
2. Make intelligent mode more intelligent.
3. Further research.

Todo, ideas:
1a. set_baserel_size_estimates needs to be splitted for the beauty of code
1b. set_baserel_rows_estimates sounds not good
2. More pain: call_default MACROS
3. Avoid memory leaks.
4. clausesel.c orclause case to be fixed
5. Where to write about hook on copy_generic_path_info?
6. Do we need initPlan in collect_planstat?
7. Problems with pfree when aqo_K changed during operation (impossbile?)
8. GUC for ml parameters?
9. object_max_distance (prediction refusal)?
10. Append and MergeAppend paths - what with them?
	ResultsPath MinMaxAgrrPath RecursiveUnionPath
11. ModifyTablePath!
12. Better to store floats, not doubles.
13. Intelligence mode is better to have optimization sandbox.
14. For intelligent mode: provide a sandbox to train unstable query types.
15. For intelligent mode: provide a possibility (and mechanism) for running
	queries on ours own wish for learning purposes.
16. Views with the same names.
17. Maybe hotfix for completely text-equal queries? What with constants
	in this case?

Code sketches:
#include "utils/lsyscache.h"
int16 typlen;
bool typbyval;
char typalign;
get_typlenbyvalalign(FLOAT8OID, &typlen, &typbyval, &typalign);
elog(WARNING, "%d %d %c", (int) typlen, (int) typbyval, typalign);
